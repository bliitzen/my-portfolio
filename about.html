             <h1>About Me</h1>
             <h3>
                My name is Christian France and I am a second year student at the University of Cincinnati studying Computer Science.
             </h3>
             <h3>              
                In high school I worked at a bagel shop as a Shift Supervisor. This was a really cool job for me because I was given a lot of responsibilities
                at a young age. My main takeaways from working there were discipline and dealing with difficult people. The owner of the shop constantly drilled me
                on everything I did which in turn pushed me towards perfection. There were times where I got frustrated with him, but I'm grateful he taught me so much at such a young age.
                Being a teenage supervisor meant I had to deal with other workers my age and even older. Leading a team was an eye opening experience at dealing with people
                and has greatly improved my interaction skills and how to deal with different types of people.
             </h3>
             <h3>
                I came to college with a strong interest in Computer Engineering because in high school we worked a lot with electronic hardware
                and I had built my own PC so it sounded very cool! I had an even stronger interest in programming so it seemed like the perfect major.
                However, COVID came along and we switched to online classes. I was taking a lot of electrical engineering courses, I had no drive to
                do anything and I felt stuck. I made the decision to switch to Computer Science to pursue my passion of programming and have never been happier in school!

                I am currently looking for a Summer 2021 Co-op and dying to gain some real world experience! I do not have any real world experience and can't
                wait for the right company to offer me an oppurtunity to learn!
