        <h1>Coding Experience</h1>
        <h2>HTML / CSS</h2>
        <h3>This portfolio was my first HTML/CSS project. Having a good base knowledge of other programming
          languages made these languages much easier to pick up. It has a much easier learning
          curve compared to other languages and will be very practical in the future. I am excited to learn more. 
        </h3>
        <h2>C++</h2>
        <h3>
          I took a strong interest in C++ when I got to college. I am currently taking a Data Structures course that is focused
          on C++. I have also started work in Unreal Engine which uses C++ to develop next level games. I want to learn more as it is a very powerful language. 
        </h3>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <h3>
          I have really only used python to make fun little 2D games (Tic-tac-toe, checkers, top-down zombies). I am currently
          taking a Python Programming course and am super excited to learn more about the language and it's uses.
        </h3>
        <h2>javascript</h2>
        <h3>
          Javascript. The language that introduced me to programming. I have a good base knowledge of javascript but quickly realized how much
          it had to offer. I am currently taking a Full Stack development course on my own time that uses a lot of javascript and it has been really cool
          to learn and I am excited to put these new skills to use.
        </h3>
        <h2>VBA</h2>
        <h3>
          I used Visual Basic in my freshman engineering course. We really didn't go too in depth with it, but it is a very practical tool to have for the future.
        </h3>
        <h2>Node.js</h2>
        <h3>
          I have used node.js a few times, for this website and the full stack course I am taking. It is confusing at times and I want to learn more about it. Added 
          to the list of courses I want to take in my free time.
        </h3>
        <h1>Electronics Experience</h1>
        <h2>Arduino</h2>
        <h3>
          My senior year of high school we worked with the City of Dublin to create air quality sensors to place around the city. We used the Arduino (similar to a raspberry pi) to run the software and hardware necessary.
          I am not sure if the cities plans came to fruition because the year ended before moving further with the project. (Never physically went outside with our devices we created)
        </h3>
        <h2>Breadboard</h2>
        <h3>
          I took a Digital Design course fall semester of my sophomore year, just before switching to Computer Science. We learned all about digital logic then applied this
          knowledge in our lab on our breadboards. It was really cool to see them work while having an understanding of why they work.
